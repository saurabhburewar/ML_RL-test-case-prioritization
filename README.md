# ML_RL-test-case-prioritization
This project is a subset of the algorithms implemented in the research paper "Reinforcement Learning for Test Case Prioritization".

## Overview
We have implemented the pointwise ranking approach for this problem and compared the performance with what is discussed in the paper. The performance of the listwise approach is the worst while the pairwise approach in the paper is said to be the best among the three ranking models. The pointwise approach, which we have successfully implemented gives almost similar performance as in the paper, however it is not the best model in the paper, hence the performance of our implementation is not equivalent to the performance given in the paper. The datasets used in the paper are publicly available, so we have used the same for our experiments.

## Run
